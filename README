Root module file containing templates for deploying resource group, virtual network, virtual machine and virtual network gateway

Manully run with directory set to customer folder:
git clone https://github.com/ChrissR3/terraform.git

Update fields container_name and sas_token in backend for customer container in storage account
update tfvars file with service principal details:
client_id       = ""
client_secret   = ""
subscription_id = ""
tenant_id       = ""

Update Following Values:
Backend:
container_name       = "<Customer Container Name>"    Name of container created in TF Storage Account
sas_token            = "<Insert Container SAS token Here>" SAS token generated on Container

az-rg:
az_rg_name     = "<RESOURCE GROUP NAME>" Name of Resource Group

az-vnet
name                = "<NAME OF VNET>" Name of the Virtual Network
subnets > name    =  "<NAME OF SUBNET>" Name of the subnet, more subnets can be added by copying block and chaning values of mapping name and address space. eg.     
"subnet3" = {
      name             = "<NAME OF SUBNET>"
      address_prefixes = ["10.100.2.0/24"]
    }

az-vm
name = "<NAME IN AZURE>"   Name of resource in Azure 

computer_name = "<HOST NAME>" Host name of VM (Can be removed if "name" is 15 characters or less, config will use "name" by default)

network interfaces > name = "<NAME>-<NICXX>" Name of network interface for VM.

ip configuration > name = "<NIC NAME>-ipconfig1" Name of IP Configuration, nicname+ipconfig1 (This config is for a single, private IP)

private_ip_subnet_resource_id = module.az-vnet.subnets["<SUBNET>"].resource_id  change "<SUBNET>" to desired subnetX (map number not name) for VM to be placed on
